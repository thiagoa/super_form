SuperForm
---------

SuperForm adopts the concept of forms, fields and fieldsets, making it easy to define fields containing
bundled validations and attributes. Form fields will be truly object oriented; that will make your code more DRY,
so you won't need to define the same validations and attributes over and over again. SuperForm also contains
fields for mundane concepts (like email and phone) - but you can still use it to code specific fields for
your application. Forms are flexible, and allow you to provide specific validations and attributes. Also, SuperForm
aims to supply a handy form builder for these fields.

This is still a work in progress, an early prototype. No release has been made yet. I'm working towards
the first release.
